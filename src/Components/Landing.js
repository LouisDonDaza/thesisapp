                    <p>Blockchain technology is considered more secure than its contemporaries because of lack of a single point of failure. Blockchain operates on a well-distributed network of nodes, hence data at all times is 
                    circulated through not one but multiple nodes, which makes sure that even if one node is hacked or faulty in any way the integrity of the original data will not be compromised.</p>

                    There is lack of security or authority in such ledgers which is not the case for private or federated ledgers that can also be integrated into a blockchain system. 
                    Thatâ€™s because the ledger on the network is maintained by all other users on the system. This distributed computational power across the computers to ensure a better outcome.</p>
